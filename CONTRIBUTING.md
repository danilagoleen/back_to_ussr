# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to BACK_TO_USSR.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `feat/your-idea` or `fix/your-bug`.
3. Make focused commits with clear messages.
4. Open a Pull Request to `main`.

## Development Notes
- Target compatibility: macOS 11+.
- Keep Intel support stable (`x86_64`) as baseline.
- Do not commit private subscription URLs or personal keys.
- For protocol/parser changes, include tests.

## Good First Ideas
- Universal build (`x86_64 + arm64`).
- Better diagnostics in menu status.
- Import/export for subscription profiles.
- Additional localization (RU/EN polish).
